      "KDA: now with assists (a touch) factored in - will help balance some champions whose goal is more about helping than doing the final blow, higher is better\n",

      "champDeaths: strict number of champion deaths - lower is better\n",
      "csPerGame: creep score per game, a way of getting gold passively - higher is better\n",
      "\n",
      "winRate: previous win rate on this champion - probably expected to the best predictor - obviously, higher is better\n",
      "\n",
      "dmgPerGame: damage you have done - more is better for the most part though some champions are built to dish out more damage while others are meant for protecting so may be noisy\n",
      "\n",
      "maxDeaths: when doing poorly, how bad does it get, can you stay relevant? - lower is better\n",
      "\n",
      "maxKills: when on a rampage and doing well, how well can you do - higher is better\n",
      "\n",
      "turretsPerGame: turrets are part of objectives - the more turrets you take, the closer you are to winning - however, this statistic is only granted to the player who does the destroying blow on the turret so won't be as high on team players\n",
      "\n",
      "damageTakenPerGame: damage taken is unclear - in general, less is better if its things you can dodge, but some champions are supposed to be the protectors and meat shields so more damage taken may be them doing their job\n",
      "\n",
      "doublesPerGame, triplesPerGame, quadrasPerGame, pentasPerGame: a statistic of getting back to back kills, probably correlated with number of kills but can be the resut of some luck, probably not expected to be statistically significant but more for entertainment in casting and to boast - higher is better\n",
      "\n",
      "firstBloodPerGame: a rarer stat, that is only granted to the first killer in each game - would indicate that early leads are good, but probably not always true and not enough data out there since there is only 1/10 the information - higher still better\n",
      "\n",
      "goldPerGame: everything boils down to gold, kills, creep score as gold lets you buy stronger items and be stronger, but in the end, the smarter team wins, not necessarily the richer (though there should be a positive correlation) - higher is better"
