<p>Every day, around the world, there are 27 million unique players on League. In comparison, World of Warcraft, which you may have heard of being hyper-addicting, only ever brought in 12 million players per day at its peak.</p>
<p>There are professional teams from every continent. The world championship this year was held in the Seoul Olympic Stadium, attended to live by 45,000. They competed for a $1,000,000 grand prize and the opening ceremony included a commissioned piece for League of Legends by Imagine Dragons (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0AvmP94n0">found here!</a>)</p>
<p>The overall viewership of the 2013 League World Finals was 32 million, beating viewership of both the NBA finals and Game 7 of the 2014 World Series, (at 15.5 million and 23.5 million,respectively).</p>
<p>With so many games being played, the data of League of Legends is just as readily available as statistics in other sports. It's time to apply data science to League of Legends.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How To Play</h3>

<p>10 players spawn onto a map, 5 per side. One player can only control one champion. There are paths to reach the other team's base, protected by destructible but damaging towers. The first team to destroy the other team's base wins. Players can earn gold to buy items to become stronger. Gold is earned through killing enemy minions (computer spawned AI pawns) or successfully killing an enemy champion. When a champion dies, he or she will be respawned on a timer that increases over time. When uncontested, objectives such as parts of the base can be destroyed - leading to victory.</p>
<p>Each League game starts from a reset map, like each game of chess. Everyone starts from the same position but it's up to how you make your moves that distinguishes the good from the bad.</p>
<p>For a more visual description or for even more details, we'll let Riot Games make their pitch: http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/what-is-lol/</p>
<p>Or perhaps watch a League Game currently being streamed live on Twitch.tv: http://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/League%20of%20Legends</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
